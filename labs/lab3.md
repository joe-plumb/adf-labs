# Lab 3 - Key Vault (AKV)

## Purpose

Azure Key Vault (AK) is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys. AKV service supports two types of containers: vaults and managed hardware security module (HSM) pools. Vaults support storing software and HSM-backed keys, secrets, and certificates. Managed HSM pools only support HSM-backed keys.
For this series of labs we will be creating a Key vault to store the password for an Azure SQLDB that utilises SQL Authentication.
